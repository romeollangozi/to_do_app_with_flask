# TO-DO WEB APP

This project was for learning purposes about Flask library SQLAlchemy. I have created a simple to-do list with user authentication and a dedicated database to hold users data and to-do notes. All the website aspects where build with
Flask, SQLAlchemy was used as our ORM(Object Relational Mapper) to make queries to the database.
The database engine we used was SQLite a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, database engine. Flask-Login was used to provide user session management for Flask. It handles the common tasks of logging in, logging out, and remembering your usersâ€™ sessions over extended periods of time.
